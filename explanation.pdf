The attached main.cpp file uses the Ceasar/Shift Cipher for encrypting a given string.
The key used in the program is 3. That is, each character is shifted by 3 units.
For example, 'a' becomes 'd' and 'f' becomes 'i'.

This is one of the oldest ciphers and hence can be easily broken.
Brute force analysis is not too long.
Letter Frequency Analysis would give smarter results easily.
As we know in the English dictionary are e,a,r,t and i.
If the attacker gets hold of considerable amounts of ciphertext, they can easily find out the key
and the plaintext would be revealed.
